{% include JB/setup %}

My name is Matt Rasmussen. I'm a hacker, tinkerer, maker, and computer engineer. I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego. I have a passion for making technology do new and interesting things, and learning as many skills as I can -- I've dabbled in everything from embedded systems to kernel hacking to robotics and human interface devices to webapp development. 

My primary goal with this site is to have a place to document the projects I work on, though I also enjoy gaming, hiking, photography, and video production; these things may pop up from time to time as well.

The best ways to get ahold of me tend to be <a href="mailto:mrasmus@gmail.com">email</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/mrasmus/">Twitter</a>; if you've got any questions for me, feel free to drop me a line!

## Projects

### UbiCondo
My current research at UCSD; a ubiquitous computing application that uses Microsoft's Kinect to track users, allowing them to perform simple gestures such as pointing to coordinate inter-device communications (sending data from one computer to another, generally in the form of browser tabs), control lights and music systems, and more. Right now I'm working to convert it from a proof-of-concept demo into an extensible framework to be open sourced. As it nears release-ready state, I'll be blogging about it a fair bit; until then, the SIGGRAPH WIP report on it is available for anyone interested.

### <a href="http://iggmarathon.com/">Indie Games for Good</a>
An annual charity gaming marathon for <a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/">Child's Play Charity</a> started in 2011, organized with the help of over 30 people. I'm the lead organizer, technical lead for video production (the event is streamed live for ~75 hours straight each year), and the developer of our most recent webapp for donor participation and donation tracking. To date we've raised over $20,000 for hospitalized children.

### UCSD IEEE RoboMagellan (ANA/ANA Type-R)
An autonomous vehicle competition I participated in from 2009-2010 with the UCSD IEEE team -- it was a small (RC-car scale) vehicle which navigated a multi-terrain course using GPS and other sensors to avoid obstacles and hit a goal. In 2009 I was the embedded systems lead (designing, building, and leading the firmware development for our interface boards), and in 2010 I was team captain; we earned 3rd place in the 2010 RobolyGames in San Mateo despite a critical hardware failure.
