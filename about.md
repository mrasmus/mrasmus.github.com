My name is Matt Rasmussen. I'm a hacker, tinkerer, maker, and computer engineer. I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego. I have a passion for making technology do new and interesting things, and learning as many skills as I can -- I've dabbled in everything from embedded systems to kernel hacking to robotics and human interface devices to webapp development. 

My primary goal with this site is to have a place to document the projects I work on, though I also enjoy gaming, hikes, photography, and video production; these things may pop up from time to time as well.

The best ways to get ahold of me tend to be email and Twitter (below); if you've got any questions for me, feel free to drop me a line!
