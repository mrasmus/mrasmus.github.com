Welcome to my new blog. I'm using this as a way to encourage myself to share thoughts and document projects, though I'm not certain yet exactly how much of what will end up on here, so forgive me if things are a bit scattershot until I find a groove for it.

As this is an introductory page, I suppose an introduction of myself is in order: I'm an technologist, hacker, and engineer studying computer science at UC San Diego; I've been hacking, tinkering, and making since before I can remember, and am a bit of a generalist. I'd like to classify myself as "curious and passionate about learning new things", but the way my brain tends to jump from subject to subject often makes me come across as unfocused. 

As an autodidact, I tend to learn enough about a topic to satiate my curiosity, answer my questions, and maybe get halfway to implementing a project, then get distracted by something else. I've got a pile of projects between the "planned" and "half-executed" stages that dwarfs my finished creations, which also betrays the fact that my perfectionism tends to cripple the likelihood of me reaching a final product; I'm honestly hoping that sharing some of my ideas, plans, and projects here will help me in tricking myself into finishing more stuff, but at the end of the day at least I'll have achieved [the "ghost of done"](http://www.brepettis.com/blog/2009/3/3/the-cult-of-done-manifesto.html).

I'll also likely post random musings from time to time on technology, gaming, and whatever else strikes my fancy. I hope you enjoy my perpetually-sleep-deprived, needlessly-verbose, weird rantings!
